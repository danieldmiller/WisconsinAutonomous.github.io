The Secure Shell (`ssh`) is a popular tool for remotely accessing and working with servers or computers. There are other ways to do this, but as the name suggests, `ssh` automatically encrypts data sent over the network, providing a private and secure connection. It has become the chosen tool for remote connections. 

`ssh` will allow us to access the workstation without physically going into the shop and lets multiple people use the workstation at once. Furthermore, we can set up things called `ssh` Tunnels to allow specific ports and software to communicate to one another between computers.

## Setup Guide

`ssh` is a common tool, but requires software to run it. The installation requirements vary between operating systems, so please use the correct guide for your OS.

To `ssh` to our workstation, you _must_ have a CAE account. Please see [this post](/posts/work-station-setup#cae-account) for details.

### Windows

There are several ways to use the `ssh` utility on Windows, a few will be outlined here. For a more in depth explanation for how to `ssh` on Windows operating systems, please visit [this site](https://www.howtogeek.com/311287/how-to-connect-to-an-ssh-server-from-windows-macos-or-linux/).

#### PowerShell

Windows 10 has recently added an "optional feature" that allows you to use `ssh` from within PowerShell. Visit [this site](https://www.howtogeek.com/336775/how-to-enable-and-use-windows-10s-built-in-ssh-commands/) for instructions on how to install that.

Once that's setup, you can use the `ssh` command directly in PowerShell. Please then run the following command to access the work station. _Replace `<cae username>` with your actual CAE username_:
```shell
ssh -J <cae username>@best-tux.cae.wisc.edu <cae username>@carproject-06.engr.wisc.edu
```

The above command will simply allow you to access the computer remotely. If you are logging in for the first time, your account will be created automatically. If the above command returns an error, please see the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

#### PuTTY

Before the advent of the `ssh` utility in PowerShell in Windows 10, [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) was the chosen `ssh` client for windows. Please [download PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) before proceeding.

Open the PuTTY application and create a new session. In the Host Name field, put `<cae username>@best-tux.cae.wisc.edu` and in Port, put `22`. Connection type should be SSH. An example configuration (make sure you replace the hostname) is below.

This should bring you to a terminal window. You are now remotely connected to the CAE computers. Next, you need to `ssh` into the workstation. The CAE computers run Linux, so you can use `ssh` directly from the command line. Run the command below to access our workstation:
```shell
ssh <cae username>@carproject-06.engr.wisc.edu
```

The above steps will simply allow you to access the computer remotely. If you are logging in for the first time, your account will be created automatically. If the above command returns an error, please see the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

### Unix

Most Linux distributions and MacOS will come preinstalled with `ssh`. For Linux or Mac systems, we recommend using a terminal application as you will improve your command line skills and it's the chosen way to use `ssh` for many.

The `ssh` command is used to now remotely connect to other computers. In the case of our workstation, _most_ students must first `ssh` into the CoE computers and then to the workstation. This is because of a firewall setup by CoE so that outside users can't access our computer. Some students may [split or full vpn access](https://kb.wisc.edu/cae/page.php?id=5573) through the CoE. Graduate students, faculty and staff will automatically have access to the CoE vpn. Undergraduates with a valid reason can gain access; unfortunately, Wisconsin Autonomous is not enough. Feel free to inquire with CoE if you'd like vpn access.

To now `ssh` to the workstation, run the following command. _Replace `<cae username>` with your actual CAE username_:

```shell
ssh -J <cae username>@best-tux.cae.wisc.edu <cae username>@carproject-06.engr.wisc.edu
```

The `-J` directive stands for `ProxyJump` and allows you to _jump_ through a host to another host.

The above command will simply allow you to access the computer remotely. If you are logging in for the first time, your account will be created automatically. If the above command returns an error, please see the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

## SSH Tunnel

An `ssh` Tunnel, also called `ssh` Port Forwarding, is a method for transporting network data over an encrypted `ssh` connection. It can be used to forward network traffic over a specific port between two computers.

Depending on the work you're doing with the workstation, you may need to forward ports `8000` (for [JupyterHub](/posts/jupyter-hub)) or `5901` (for [VNC](/posts/vnc)). You can use the `-L` directive to forward ports to your local machine.

```shell
ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 -J <cae username>@best-tux.cae.wisc.edu <cae username>@carproject-06.engr.wisc.edu
```

Visit [this site](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/tunneling/example) for more information on port forwarding.

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied

Some may get an error that looks like the following:
```console
user@name:~$ ssh name@carproject-06.engr.wisc.edu
name@carproject-06.engr.wisc.edu's password:
Permission denied, please try again.
name@carproject-06.engr.wisc.edu's password:
Permission denied, please try again.
name@carproject-06.engr.wisc.edu's password:
Permission denied (publickey,password).
```

As the errors demonstrate, you most likely do not have permission to use the workstation. Please see [this section](/posts/work-station-setup#account-registration) for details on how to gain access.
